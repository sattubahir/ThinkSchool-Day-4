# JavaScript Basics Examples

This file contains fundamental JavaScript code snippets demonstrating key programming concepts such as variables, data types, strings, arrays, loops, and conditionals.

## Variables and Data Types

- Declare and use numeric variables with `let`.
- Perform arithmetic operations and show type checking using `typeof`.


## Arrays

- Create arrays, access elements, and check length.
- Add and remove elements using `push`, `unshift`, `pop`, and `shift`.
- Search and check presence of items.


## Strings

- Concatenate strings and check length.
- Access characters and use string methods.



## Loops

- Basic for loops from 0 to 4.
- Loop with increment, break, continue, nested loops, and decrementing loops.


## Conditionals

- Simple `if`, `if-else`, `if-else if-else` chains.
- Logical operators and nested conditions.
