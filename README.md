# JavaScript Learning Project: Basics, DOM & Debugging

## Project Overview

This project is designed to build foundational skills in JavaScript programming through practical tasks across three sessions:  
- **Session 2:** JavaScript Basics — variables, data types, control flow  
- **Session 3:** DOM and Events — selecting elements, event handling, DOM manipulation  
- **Session 4:** Debugging — using browser DevTools and VS Code to step through code

## Sessions and Deliverables

### Session 2 - JavaScript Basics

- **Tasks:** Write exercises covering variables, strings, arrays, loops, and conditionals.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - `js-basics.md` with solved exercises and explanations.  
  - `/src/js/basics.js` containing code snippets for all exercises.  
- **Resources:**  
  - [MDN JS First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)  
  - [MDN JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide)

### Session 3 - DOM and Events

- **Tasks:** Select DOM elements, listen to user events, update text and CSS classes dynamically.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - `dom-notes.md` explaining DOM concepts and event handling.  
  - `dom.js` script showing practical DOM manipulation examples.  
- **Resources:**  
  - [MDN DOM Introduction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)  
  - [MDN Event Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events)

### Session 4 - Debugging: DevTools & VS Code

- **Tasks:** Use breakpoints, watch variables, and analyze the call stack during debugging. Practice source maps later.  
- **Deliverables:**  
  - Recorded video demonstrating a debug session stepping through code with breakpoints, inspections, and call stack review.
