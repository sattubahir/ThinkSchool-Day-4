# Session 4 - Debugging: DevTools & VS Code

## Overview

This project demonstrates effective debugging techniques using browser DevTools and Visual Studio Code.

Debugging is an essential skill to understand and fix issues in code by examining program execution flow and data values.

## Task Description

**Tasks:**  
- Use breakpoints to pause code execution at specific points.  
- Monitor variables and expressions with the watch panel.  
- Analyze the call stack to understand function execution order.  
- Practice source maps later for mapping compiled code to original sources.

**Deliverable:**  
- A recorded video showing a complete debugging session, demonstrating:  
  - Setting and using breakpoints  
  - Inspecting variables and watching expressions  
  - Stepping through code line-by-line  
  - Examining the call stack  
  - Explaining debugging insights during the session

## How to Run and Debug

1. Open the source code in your preferred editor (VS Code recommended).  
2. Launch the webpage in a browser to debug in DevTools or start the VS Code debugger.  
3. Set breakpoints on key lines in the JavaScript files.  
4. Interact with the app to trigger breakpoints and pause execution.  
5. Use debugger controls to step into/out/over functions.  
6. Watch variables' values update and use the call stack panel for navigation.  
7. Record your screen showing this session with narration if possible.
